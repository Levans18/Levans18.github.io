                <p>
                    My current objective for my career is to intern at a company that can use the skills that
                    I have acquired and to help me hone those skills. The job title that I'm looking for is 
                    Software Engineering which for now is focused in the front-end portion of websites and apps.

                <h2>Lifelong</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my goals in life is lifelong learning. This was one of the big contributing
                    factors in what I majored in college. The overall flexibility and everchanging nature 
                    of computer science is what I like the most about it. You never really know what tomorrow
                    holds and you get to explore all kinds of languages and frameworks that are created every day.
