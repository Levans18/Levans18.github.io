                <h2>Current</h2>
                <p>
                    My current objective for my career is to intern at a company that can use the skills that
                    I have acquired and to help me hone those skills. The job title that I'm looking for is 
                    Software Engineering which for now is focused in the front-end portion of websites and apps.
                    At that job I would like to work closely with both front and back-end developers to learn from 
                    while creating projects with them. At my first job I want to bring a great attitude to relieve some 
                    coworker tension and have fun with what i'm doing While I learn all of these skills I plan on investing a 
                    large poriton of my money into different outlets including things like real estate and the stock
                    market to gain capital that I can use for my future plans.

                    Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My future objective for my career once I have been in the field for many years is that I have 
                    the ability to work as a full-stack developer rather than just front-end. Far down the line past
                    that I strive to have a business of my own hopefully in a new kind of tech that is created in the 
                    upcoming years which I will fund with my invested money from early in my career. While this is not
                    set in stone I hope to have many options and have influenced the lives of people around me positively 
                    along the way.

                <h2>Lifelong</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my goals in life is lifelong learning. This was one of the big contributing
                    factors in what I majored in college. The overall flexibility and everchanging nature 
                    of computer science is what I like the most about it. You never really know what tomorrow
                    holds and you get to explore all kinds of languages and frameworks that are created every day.
